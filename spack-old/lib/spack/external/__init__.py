"""This module contains the following external, potentially separately
licensed, packages that are included in Spack:

altgraph
--------

* Homepage: https://altgraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html
* Usage: dependency of macholib
* Version: 0.17.2

archspec
--------

* Homepage: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/archspec
* Usage: Labeling, comparison and detection of microarchitectures
* Version: 0.1.4 (commit e2cfdc266174488dee78b8c9058e36d60dc1b548)

argparse
--------

* Homepage: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/argparse
* Usage: We include our own version to be Python 3.X compatible.
* Version: 1.4.0
* Note: This package has been slightly modified to improve
  error message formatting. See the following commit if the
  vendored copy ever needs to be updated again:
  https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/6786/commits/dfcef577b77249106ea4e4c69a6cd9e64fa6c418

astunparse
----------------

* Homepage: https://github.com/simonpercivall/astunparse
* Usage: Unparsing Python ASTs for package hashes in Spack
* Version: 1.6.3 (plus modifications)
* Note: This is in ``spack.util.unparse`` because it's very heavily
  modified, and we want to track coverage for it.
  Specifically, we have modified this library to generate consistent unparsed ASTs
  regardless of the Python version. It is based on:
    1. The original ``astunparse`` library;
    2. Modifications for consistency;
    3. Backports from the ``ast.unparse`` function in Python 3.9 and later
  The unparsing is now mostly consistent with upstream ``ast.unparse``, so if
  we ever require Python 3.9 or higher, we can drop this external package.

* Usage: Needed by jsonschema.
* Version: 21.2.0 (83d3cd70f90a3f4d19ee8b508e58d1c58821c0ad)
