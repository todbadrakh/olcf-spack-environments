  # Views are managed externally; placing them here triggers a regneration each
  # time the env is re-concretized which both destroys non-spack files (eg
  # symlinks) in "hybrid views" and removes previous builds slated to be
  # re-built from the production view when we want to minimize disruption to
  # users. See $FACSPACK_CONF_ENV/view-generate-*.sh scripts for managing views.
